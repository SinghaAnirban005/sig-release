## As a follow up on: <!-- #<issue> typically the rc.0 cut issue (currently the branch is created by krel during that cut process) -->

## Tasks

<!--

Follow the docs here: https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/release-engineering/handbooks/post-release-branch-creation.md

Help? Ring @release-managers on slack!

-->

- [ ] Create a thread in #release-management: <!-- Paste link to Slack thread -->
- [ ] Coordinate the next alpha release cut - <!-- mention @release-managers nudging them to perform the propedeutic tasks for the next alpha (e.g. setting up the new OBS project) -->
- [ ] (optional) Remove jobs for EOL versions, **only** if agreed upon with Release Managers
<!--
Branch Managers might not have a context on if it is "safe" to remove the EOL jobs. We try to be firm with the deadlines and stop cutting patches as soon as we reach the EOL date, but e.g. there might be a new patch needed because of some important security fix, in which case only Release Managers will know about that.

There might be a significant time/delay between the release reaching EOL and the new branch being created, leaving those jobs hanging for a while, which has an impact on the project infra costs.

The trigger for removing such jobs should be solely the EOL date but we shouldn't connect getting rid of EOL jobs and the new branch creation. Even if has been like that before, it shouldn't be longterm.
-->
- [ ] Update [`milestone_applier` rules](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/config/prow/plugins.yaml)
