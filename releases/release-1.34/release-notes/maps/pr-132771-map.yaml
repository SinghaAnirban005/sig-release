  text: Added support in the kubelet's image pull credential tracking for service account-based
    verification. When an image was pulled using service account credentials via external
    credential providers, subsequent Pods using the same service account (UID, name,
    and namespace) could access the cached image without re-authentication for the
    lifetime of that service account.
