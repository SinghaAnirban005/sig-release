  text: Fixed an issue where the kubelet token cache returned stale tokens when service
    accounts were recreated with the same name. The cache is now UID-aware. Additionally,
    the new `TokenRequestServiceAccountUIDValidation` feature gate (Beta, enabled
    by default) ensures the `TokenRequest` UID matches the service account UID when
    set.
