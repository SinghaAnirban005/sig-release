  text: Graduated `PodObservedGenerationTracking` feature to beta and had it on by
    default. This feature meant that the top level `status.observedGeneration` and
    `status.conditions[].observedGeneration` fields in Pods were populated to reflect
    the `metadata.generation` of the podspec at the time that the status or condition
    was reported.
