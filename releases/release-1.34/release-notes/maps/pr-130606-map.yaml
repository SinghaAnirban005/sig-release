  text: The Kubelet could monitor the health of devices allocated via Dynamic Resource
    Allocation (DRA) and report it in the `pod.status.containerStatuses.allocatedResourcesStatus`
    field. This required the DRA plugin to implement the new v1alpha1 `NodeHealth`
    gRPC service. This feature was controlled by the `ResourceHealthStatus` feature
    gate.
