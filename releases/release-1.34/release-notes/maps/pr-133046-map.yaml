  text: Added validation to reject Pods using the `PodLevelResources` feature on Windows
    OS due to lack of support. The API server rejected Pods with pod-level resources
    and a `Pod.spec.os.name` targeting Windows. Kubelet on nodes running Windows also
    rejected Pods with pod-level resources at the admission phase.
