  text: Added the `DetectCacheInconsistency` feature gate, allowing the API server
    to periodically verify consistency between its `cache` and `etcd`. Detected inconsistencies
    reported via the `apiserver_storage_consistency_checks_total` metric and trigger
    purging of affected cache snapshots.
